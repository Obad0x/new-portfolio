      ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm an 18-year-old developer who's always on the lookout to build and ship exciting products. You'll find most of my quirky and experimental repositories public on GitHub, where I love to share my journey of learning and growth. 
      ðŸš€ Currently, I'm passionately working on "Otakuhaven" - a project that holds a special place in my heart. 
      If you're curious to learn more about it, feel free to visit "otakuhavenhq" on Instagram for some sneak peeks and behind-the-scenes action! ðŸ’¬ I'm all about collaboration and teamwork. 
      If you're interested in joining forces on a project or just want to chat about anything tech-related, 
      don't hesitate to slide into my DMs on Twitter. You can find me at @Obad0x. Let's create something awesome together! ðŸŽ‰
